This is my second fully functioning web game.
10 June 2023.

//  FUNCTIONALITY  //

-the application fetches questions from a public API and displays them as a game on screen.

-The player has the option to select the difficulty and the category of the questions.

-Based on the selected options the player will gain different ammount of points.

-The points are added up to the total score that will be displayed in the score board. 
 The score board will show all the scores of all the players who played the game previously ()upload from local storage).

- the game has a timer. If the count down will be done, the game ends.

//  ARCHITECTURE  //

I  have implemented MVC architecture. 
In my opinion it is the most convinient architecture that fits this kind of a small project.
The MVC architecture wes spreaded to model, controller and view files (one file for each).
